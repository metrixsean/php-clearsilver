Version 0.3
Author: Sean Montgomery

- registered clearsilver filters in cs_init (this is for html_escape, js_escape, etc)
  this required adding a dependency of neo_cgi to the make file
- replaced hdf_set_value with an unreleased version from 0.2, which uses php itself to print the mixed variable
- added clearsilver extension version to phpinfo output
